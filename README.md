As an eCommerce Database Analyst, I evaluated historical web traffic and conversion data to help Maven Fuzzy Factory optimize marketing spend.

# Web Traffic Analysis – SQL & Excel Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes simulated eCommerce traffic data to identify the most effective marketing channels, evaluate conversion performance, and guide bid optimization strategies. The work began as a SQL-based analysis but was extended to include an interactive Excel dashboard for better visualization.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Identify top-performing traffic sources.
- Measure conversion rates (CVR) across campaigns.
- Assess the impact of bidding strategy changes.
- Compare device-level performance for targeted optimizations.

## 📊 Key Insights
1. **Traffic Source Dominance** – Gsearch non-brand campaigns contributed over 97% of sessions.
2. **Conversion Performance** – Gsearch non-brand achieved ~2.83% CVR.
3. **Bidding Sensitivity** – Lowering bids caused a sharp drop in sessions.
4. **Device Comparison** – Desktop CVR was 3.73% vs. mobile at 0.96%.
5. **Post-Bid Optimization** – Increased desktop bids boosted desktop sessions while mobile traffic declined.

## 📂 Deliverables
- **SQL Queries** – Extracted and aggregated session, conversion, and device-type data.
- **Excel Dashboard** – Visualized traffic trends, CVR performance, and bid strategy results.

## 💡 Recommendations
- Increase desktop bid allocation for higher ROI.
- Improve mobile user experience to raise mobile CVR.
- Run targeted A/B tests to refine campaign performance.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
